# Contributing to CodeGlossary

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CodeGlossary! Your efforts will help make coding terminology accessible to a broader audience. Please follow these steps to ensure a smooth contribution process:

## 1. Fork the Repository

Click the **Fork** button at the top right corner of the [CodeGlossary repository](https://github.com/devhots/CodeGlossary) to create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

## 2. Create a New Branch

Create a new branch in your forked repository. The name of the branch should be your username.

```bash
git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
```

## 3. Structure and Naming Convention

Our files are structured alphabetically into folders. If your term starts with `A`, for instance, inside that folder `A`, add a markdown file named in kebab-case (e.g., `github-repository.md`).

## 4. Dual Explanations

Each terminology should have two types of explanations:

### Simple Explanation

Provide a concise definition of the term in around 600-800 characters. Be clear and straightforward while highlighting its significance.

### Explaining like you're five

Break down the term as if explaining to a child. Use simple language, analogies, and examples that a 5-year-old could understand (in 500-600 character).

> Note : You can take a example of [Agile Methodology](/Glossary/A/agile-methodology.md)

## 5. Update Table of Contents

Add a link to your newly created file in the main README's table of contents. Make sure it's in alphabetical order for easy navigation.

## 6. Create a Pull Request

Once you've added your term's explanations and updated the table of contents, create a pull request from your branch to the main repository. Use the term's name as the title of the pull request.

Remember the following guidelines:

- Each pull request should cover only one term.
- If you have multiple terms to contribute, create separate pull requests for each.
- Please maintain a clear commit history, with meaningful commit messages.

## 7. Review and Iterate

Your pull request will be reviewed by our team. Be prepared to address any feedback or suggestions for improvement. Collaboration is key to creating a valuable resource.

Thank you for being a part of the CodeGlossary community and helping others understand coding concepts better!
