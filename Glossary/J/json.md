## Explaining like you're five

Imagine you have a special box where you keep your favorite toys. JSON is like a magic language that helps you tell your friend what toys are in your box and why you love them. It's a way for computers to talk about things they know, like your toys, so they can understand each other better and have fun together! Just like you talk about your toys with your friend, JSON helps computers talk about their stuff too.
