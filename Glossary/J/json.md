# JSON

JSON stands for "JavaScript Object Notation." It's a lightweight data interchange format used to represent and exchange data between different systems. JSON is easy for both humans to read and write, and for machines to parse and generate. It's commonly used for sending data between a server and a web application, as well as for storing configuration data and exchanging information between APIs.Key features of JSON include:

#### Syntax Simplicity-

JSON uses a simple and intuitive syntax made up of key-value pairs. It closely resembles the syntax used in JavaScript objects.

#### Data Types-

JSON supports various data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, and null values.

#### Structured Format-

Data in JSON is organized hierarchically using objects (which are collections of key-value pairs) and arrays (which are ordered lists of values).

#### Language Neutrality-

While it originated from JavaScript, JSON is not limited to a specific programming language. It's widely supported across different programming languages.

#### Compatibility with Web-

JSON is a natural fit for web development due to its resemblance to JavaScript objects. It's commonly used for sending data between a server and a web application using AJAX requests.

## In a nutshell -

JSON is like a digital language for sharing information. It uses simple rules to organize data into key-value pairs, making it easy for both people and computers to understand. It's often used to send and receive data between different programs or systems, like a common language that computers can speak to each other. Just as you might write down your name and age, JSON helps computers share and understand information in a structured way.
