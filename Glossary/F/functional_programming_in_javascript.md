# Functional Programming in JavaScript

Functional Programming in JavaScript is an approach to writing code that focuses on using functions as the primary building blocks of programs. Instead of treating code as a sequence of steps, functional programming treats code as a series of functions that take input, process it, and produce output. This style encourages immutability, meaning that data once created cannot be changed, and the avoidance of side effects, which are changes made by a function that affect the outside world.Key concepts in functional programming with JavaScript include: Pure Functions, Higher-Order Function, Function Composition, Closure etc.

## Explaining like you're five

Functional Programming in JavaScript is like building with LEGO blocks. You use small, self-contained functions to do specific tasks. These functions don't change things outside themselves and always give the same output for the same input. You combine these functions to create bigger, more complex processes. It's a way of writing code that's clear, predictable, and easy to put together and take apart.
