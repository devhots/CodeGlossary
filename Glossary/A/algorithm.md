# Algorithm

An algorithm is a procedure used for solving a problem or performing a computation. Algorithms act as an exact list of instructions that conduct specified actions step-by-step in either hardware or software-based routines. In simple terms it is a step-by-step set of instructions to solve a problem or perform a task.

Algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations and data processing. More advanced algorithms can use conditionals to divert the code execution through various routes (referred to as automated decision-making) and deduce valid inferences (referred to as automated reasoning), achieving automation eventually. 

## Explaining like you are five

Now, Imagine you have a big box of colorful blocks, and you want to build a tower using those blocks. An algorithm is like a special set of instructions that tells you exactly how to put the blocks together to make the tower.

Think of it as a step-by-step guide that you can follow. It's like having a friend tell you what to do next. So, when you want to build the tower, you can look at your guide (the algorithm), and it will show you which block to put on first, then which one comes next, and so on, until your tower is all built and ready to play with! Algorithms help us solve problems and do things in a specific order, just like building with blocks.
