# Debugging

Debugging is the process of identifying, analyzing, and fixing errors, bugs, or issues in software code or a computer program. Software development involves writing complex code, and errors can easily occur due to mistakes in coding, logical flaws, or unexpected interactions between different components of the software. Debugging is crucial for ensuring that the software functions as intended and produces the expected results.

## Explaining like you're five

Remember when your toy train stopped on the tracks? You looked closely to see why and then fixed it, so it ran smoothly again. Debugging is like that, but for computer games. Programmers check why things are not working, like finding why a game gets stuck, and they fix it to make it play perfectly.
