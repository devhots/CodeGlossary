# Browser Compatibility

Browser compatibility refers to how well a website or web application works and looks across different web browsers, like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Since each browser might interpret and display code slightly differently, developers need to ensure that their creations function consistently and provide a good user experience, regardless of the browser a person uses. This involves testing, adjusting code, and using techniques that make sure everyone, no matter their browser choice, can access and use the website or app without any hiccups. üåêüîç

Browser compatibility refers to ensuring that a website or web application functions correctly and looks consistent across various web browsers. This involves testing, adjusting code, and using standards-compliant practices to provide a seamless user experience, regardless of the browser being used.
