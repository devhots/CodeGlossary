# Compiler

A compiler is a program that helps turn the code that humans write into instructions that computers can understand. Think of it as a language translator, but for computers. When programmers write code, they use words and rules that humans understand, but computers need a different kind of language to follow those instructions. The compiler takes the programmer's code and translates it into a language that the computer can read and execute. It's like having a magical friend who can change your story into a language only your toys can understand.

## Explaining like you're five

Imagine you're telling a robot how to draw a picture. You use your words, but robots like different words. A compiler is like a robot helper â€“ it listens to your words and tells the robot what to do using robot words. So even if you say "draw a smile," the compiler helps the robot know exactly how to do it.
