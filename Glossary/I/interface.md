# Interface

An interface is like a way for different things to talk to each other or work together. It can mean the buttons and screens we use on computers, the rules that help software programs talk to each other, or even the plugs and connections that link gadgets to computers. Interfaces make sure different stuff can understand each other and get things done together.

## Explaining like you're five

An interface is like a magic button that helps you talk to your toys. Imagine you have a remote control for your toy car. When you press the buttons on the remote, the car knows what to do - it can go forward, turn around, or even make funny sounds. An interface is a bit like that remote control. It's a special way for different things, like toys or computer programs, to understand each other and work together. Just like you use the buttons on the remote to control your toy, an interface helps things understand how to talk and play nicely with each other.
