## Explaining like you're five

Interactive web design is like having a website that talks and plays with you! Imagine you have a coloring book on the computer. Instead of just looking at the pictures, you can actually color them by clicking on the colors. And when you move your mouse over buttons, they do fun things like light up or make sounds. It's like a computer game, but on a website! Interactive web design makes websites feel like they're alive and want to play with you.
