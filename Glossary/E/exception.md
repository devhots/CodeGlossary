# Exception

An exception is an unexpected event or condition that occurs during the execution of a program, disrupting its normal flow. It typically arises when an error or special situation is encountered that the program cannot handle as part of its usual operations. Exceptions can cover various issues, such as division by zero, attempting to access a non-existent file, or trying to use a resource that's not available. In programming, developers can implement exception handling mechanisms to catch and manage these special situations. By using try-catch blocks or similar constructs, developers can identify when an exception occurs, gracefully handle it, and potentially take corrective actions to prevent program crashes and ensure more robust and reliable software.

## Explaining like you're five

An exception is when a computer says, "Whoa, that's not what I expected!" Like when you're coloring and your crayon rolls away, it's a surprise. In computer games, if something surprising happens, programmers make sure the game knows what to do, just like you know to pick up your crayon.
