# HTTP AND HTTPS

HTTP stands for "Hypertext Transfer Protocol." It's like a set of rules that computers follow when they talk to each other on the internet. Imagine you're sending a letter to a friend. HTTP is like the special way you write the letter so your friend's computer can understand and send you back a response.

HTTPS is like a super safe version of HTTP. It adds an extra layer of protection, like a secret code, to your letters. This way, when you send important things like passwords or credit card numbers online, they stay private and nobody else can read them. So, HTTP is like regular mail, and HTTPS is like a secret, locked envelope that keeps your stuff safe!

## Explaining like you're five

Imagine you're sending a message to a friend through your toy walkie-talkies. HTTP is like talking openly, and anyone with a walkie-talkie can hear what you're saying. But HTTPS is like using a secret code when you talk. Only you and your friend can understand the secret code, so your messages stay private and safe from anyone trying to listen in. It's like whispering your secrets so only your friend can hear!
