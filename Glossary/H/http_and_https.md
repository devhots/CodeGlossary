# HTTP AND HTTPS

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) are protocols used for communication between web browsers and web servers. They define how data is transferred between a user's browser and a website, enabling the retrieval and display of web pages.

## HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

- HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the web.
- It's used when you type a website's address into your browser or click on a link.
- Data sent using HTTP is not encrypted, making it susceptible to interception and tampering.
- While it's fast and simple, it lacks security measures to protect sensitive data.

## HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):

- HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP.
- It uses encryption to protect data as it's sent between the browser and the web server.
- HTTPS is commonly used for sensitive transactions, like online payments or submitting forms with personal information.
- To enable HTTPS, a website needs an SSL/TLS certificate, which verifies its authenticity and encrypts data.

## In a nutshell

In a nutshell, HTTP and HTTPS are the languages that your browser and websites use to talk to each other. HTTP is like sending postcards – anyone can read them. HTTPS is like sending letters in a locked box – only the intended recipient can read them. HTTPS ensures that sensitive information stays private and secure as it travels between your browser and the website's server.
