# HTML

HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the foundational language used to create and structure content on websites. It uses special codes called tags to define elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. These tags tell web browsers how to display and arrange the content for users to see. HTML provides the structure and layout for web pages, while other technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) handle the visual appearance, and JavaScript adds interactivity. In essence, HTML is the building block that enables the creation of web content and allows browsers to interpret and render that content in a structured manner.

## Explaining like you're five

Imagine you're making a drawing with crayons. You have different crayons for different things, like one for drawing the sky, one for the grass, and another for the sun. HTML is a bit like those special crayons. It helps people make pictures on the computer that everyone can see on the internet. Instead of crayons, we use special words to tell the computer where to put pictures, text, and links on the screen. So, when you click on a website, the computer knows how to use the special words (HTML) to show you all the cool things on the page, just like your crayons make a beautiful picture!
